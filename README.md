# 2024-Hackathon-Cracked
dx/dp + m game created for the UNR 2024 Hackathon

This game was in creation of 2024 UNR's Biggest Little Hackathon. Prior to this competition and the creation of the project, none of the
team members had ever touched Unity nor have coded in C#. Most of the people in this group have experience in C and C++, but not a whole lot of
coding experience otherwise.

# Cracked!

Using either A/D or the left/right arrow keys, the goal of the game is to crack as many eggs as you can in the given time limit!

We are currently in the process of trying to fix the rendering of the game. Other than that, the game should be working in order.
